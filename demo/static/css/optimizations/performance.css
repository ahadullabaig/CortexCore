/* PERFORMANCE FIX: Removed permanent will-change to reduce GPU memory overhead */
/* Apply will-change selectively only during active animations */

/* GPU acceleration for cards only during scroll animations */
.card.animate-on-scroll:not(.animated) {
  will-change: transform, opacity;

  will-change: auto; /* Remove after animation completes */

/* Status metrics, result items, metric items:
   These rarely animate, so no will-change needed */
