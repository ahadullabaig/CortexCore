Neuromorphic computing — inspired by the human brain — offers energy-efficient and event-driven computation using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). This project focuses on developing a GPU-simulated neuromorphic model that mimics the efficiency of brain-inspired computation while using only software-level implementations of SNNs.

1. Problem definition:
Design and simulate a neuromorphic computing model using SNN for pattern recognition in healthcare signals (e.g., EEG, ECG, or synthetic physiological data) to detect early indicators of neurological or cardiac disorders.

The model must:
1. Be implemented entirely on conventional hardware (CPU/GPU) using SNN simulation frameworks.
2. Avoid dependence on real-world medical datasets — synthetic or open-source small datasets can be used.
3. Demonstrate energy-efficient, event-driven processing comparable to neuromorphic systems.

Model building:
o Build an SNN using software simulators like Brian2, NEST, SpikingJelly, or Norse (PyTorch-based).
o Implement biologically inspired learning rules (STDP, SpikeProp).
o Run training and inference on a GPU environment.
o Measure recognition accuracy and simulated energy efficiency compared to ANN baselines.
o Analyze spike dynamics, neuron firing rates, and interpret how the model learns temporal patterns in healthcare signals.

Output:
• A GPU-based neuromorphic simulation system for healthcare diagnosis tasks.
• Improved efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional deep learning models.

this is the problem statement for my hackathon.
